			<p>While building a product, it's easy to get caught up in 
				the illusion that the majority of your users will understand it intuitively. 
				After all, your features and updates are obvious <em>enough</em>, right?</p>
				
				<p>
				Since launching <a href="https://hyperspektiv.com">Hyperspektiv 2</a> , we've: </p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Received complaints about users losing access to features... <em>that weren't even in the app before the upgrade</em></li>
						<li>Gotten 1-stars for removing features... <em>that are still in the app</em></li>
						<li>The list goes on...</li>
					<ul>
