	  	<h1>The 90-9-1 Rule in the Creative Context</h1>
			<h2>by <a href="http://twitter.com/@lavell_xyz" target="_blank">@lavell.xyz</a></h2>
				
			<p>
				Studies of internet networks show an interesting pattern:
				<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/" target="_blank">only 1% of users publish the majority of the content</a>.	
				An additional 9% publish <em>some</em> content, with the rest publishing next
				to nothing at all.
			</p>
			
			<p>This stat shocked me at first - but when I thought more about my
				Instagram feed, it all started making sense. (lol)
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I build <a href="https://hyperspektiv.com" target="_blank">creative photo + video tools</a>. As a creator, it's easy to forget that the
				 <em>majority</em> of potential users will never publish content. Does this
				 spell doom for creator-focused projects?
			</p>
			
			<p>
			 <b>What I've found is that <em>much</em> more content is created 
				than actually shared (over 100x).</b> 
				
			</p>
			<p>Part of that can be attributed to missing optimizations in the sharing UX, as well as people
				posting without the hashtag, of course. Tweaks like these seem unlikely to account for an 
				100x difference, however. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It would seem that people actually <em>are</em> more creative on average than the 90-9-1 rule would suggest.
				It's just that creation is a fundamentally different process from 
				publishing.
